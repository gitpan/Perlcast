Perlcast Interview 010 - Interview with Larry Wall


=head1 ABSTRACT

At YAPC::NA 2005 Larry Wall agreed to sit down and talk a little about Perl. 
It’s taken a while, but here is the audio. This one was interesting to 
record, as we were in the lobby of 89 Chestnut and picked up a bit of 
background noise. Not to mention, we were recording off of a single 
unidirectional microphone. Still, I’m pretty sure that it was focused on 
the right person :)

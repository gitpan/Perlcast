Perlcast Interview 004 - Interview with Peter Scott


=head1 ABSTRACT

At OSCON 2005 I was lucky enough to get to sit down with Peter Scott and talk 
about his new book Perl Medic: Transforming Legacy Code. There is a fair 
amount of background noise for the first few minutes of the interview, but it 
quickly fades into the background.

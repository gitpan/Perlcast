Perlcast Interview 009 - Interview with Jesse Vincent


=head1 ABSTRACT

Well, I had to delay the release of my interview with Andy Lester for a few 
days, so I’m a little late getting out a replacement interview. But, better 
late then never. For this interview I speak with Jesse Vincent of Best 
Practical about his ticketing system, RT, and his new book, “RT Essentials”.

The audio of this interview can be found at

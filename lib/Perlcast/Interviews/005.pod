Perlcast Interview 005 - Interview with Chris Brooks

=head1 ABSTRACT

Recently, I got to speak with Chris Brooks about one of his latest projects, 
Talkr. In short, Talkr takes a textual blog and turns it into a podcast. 
Though the text-to-speech might not be done in Perl, there is a lot of Perl 
around in the Talkr system.

In the interview, you’ll hear about what Talkr is and how it works, as well 
as, some commentary on podcasting and entrepreneurship. Take note of the 
introduction of the interview. It is a small sample of what you’ll get from 
Talkr.
